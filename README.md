# Calculator-CodeAlpha

This is a simple calculator web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The calculator allows basic arithmetic operations and includes additional features such as using Pi (π), the mathematical constant *e*, and switching between degree and radian modes.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage.
- **Special Functions:** Includes buttons for Pi (π), Euler's number (e), and parentheses for grouping expressions.
- **Degree/Radian Toggle:** Allows trigonometric functions to be evaluated in either degrees or radians.
- **Keyboard Input Support:** You can use the number keys, arithmetic operators, and the enter, backspace, and escape keys to interact with the calculator.
- **Responsive Design:** The calculator adjusts its layout and styling depending on the screen size.

## Project Structure

-  ├── index.html # Main HTML file (structure of the calculator) 
-  ├── styles.css # CSS file (styling and animations) 
-  ├── script.js # JavaScript file (functionalities of the calculator)

## How to Use

1. **Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.**

2. **Use either mouse or keyboard to operate the calculator:**
   - Click on the buttons for inputs.
   - Use the following keyboard shortcuts:
     - `Enter`: To evaluate the expression.
     - `Backspace`: To erase the last input.
     - `Escape`: To clear the current input.

## Code Overview

### HTML (`index.html`)
This file provides the structure of the calculator interface, including the display screen and buttons.

### CSS (`styles.css`)
The styles file includes the layout, button designs, and animations like:
- **Button hover effects**
- **Button click animations**
- **Page fade-in and calculator slide-up animations**

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
This file contains the logic for handling button clicks, displaying the result, and supporting keyboard inputs. It uses `eval()` to evaluate arithmetic expressions and includes basic error handling.

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. You should see the calculator on the screen and be able to perform operations.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- **Advanced Operations:** Add more advanced mathematical functions such as square root, logarithms, and trigonometric operations.
- **Scientific Mode:** Introduce a scientific calculator mode with additional features.
- **Error Handling:** Improve error handling for invalid expressions.
